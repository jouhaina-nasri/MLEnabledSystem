The project consists of:
* [__architecture__](architecture) -  This folder contains the schematic diagram of our study (In progress).
* [__boxplot__](boxplot) - This folder contains box plots illustrating the distribution of various metrics.
* [__collect_data__](collect_data)  - This folder is used to collect the repositories, and then collect the Jupyter files.
* [__data__](data)  - This folder represents our data.
* [__extract_code__](extract_code)  -  This folder contains code used to extract the data. This code helps us to fill the manual labeling, instead of searching for files to find the desired cells. We can use this code by providing the input file path and the cell number.
* [__manual_labeling__](manual_labeling)  - This folder contains the file of manual labeling, used to validate our tool.
* [__metrics__](metrics)  -  This folder contains CSV files of metrics necessary to detect code smells.
* [__parser__](parser)  - This folder contains Python files used to extract the necessary metrics.
* [__precision_recall__](precision_recall)  - This folder contains code used to calculate precision and recall for our tool (In progress).
* [__randomly_collect_data__](randomly_collect_data)  - This folder contains R code used to randomly collect the data to be used in manual labeling.
* [__tool__](tool)  -  This code is for our tool (In progress).
