# MLEnabledSystem
Anti-Patterns in Developing ML-Enabled Systems and How to Avoid Them
---
The project consists of :
* [__BadImports__](BadImports.ipynb) - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid bad imports.
* [__BooleanParameters__](BooleanParameters.ipynb) - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid passing booleans to functions.
* [__ClassesUnnecessarily__](ClassesUnnecessarily.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using classes that should just be functions or modules
* [__CodeDuplication__](CodeDuplication.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid duplication code.
* [__CommentClutter__](CommentClutter.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using comments inside a method.
* [__DictionaryMisuse__](DictionaryMisuse.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid incorrect usage of the .keys() and .values() methods with dictionaries.
* [__ErrorHandling__](ErrorHandling.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid not specifying the exception in the 'except' clause.
* [__GlobalVariable__](GlobalVariable.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid global variable.
* [__ImmutableDefaults__](ImmutableDefaults.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid mutable defaults.
* [__LimitOutputs__](LimitOutputs.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using excessive display of irrelevant outputs or graphs.
* [__LongCells__](LongCells.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid long cells.
* [__MagicNumbers__](MagicNumbers.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid magic numbers.
* [__MarkdownCells__](MarkdownCells.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid not taking advantage of markdown cells.
* [__MultiTest__](MultiTest.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid multi-Test leakage.
* [__NestedList__](NestedList.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using nested list comprehensions.
* [__PreprocessingLeakage__](PreprocessingLeakage.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid preprocessing leakage.
* [__TestTraining__](TestTraining.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid including test Data in the training data.
* [__VagueNames__](VagueNames.ipynb)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid vague names.
