---
The project consists of :
* [__BadImports.ipynb__](BadImports) - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid bad imports.
* [__BooleanParameters.ipynb__](BooleanParameters) - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid passing booleans to functions.
* [__ClassesUnnecessarily.ipynb__](ClassesUnnecessarily)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using classes that should just be functions or modules
* [__CodeDuplication.ipynb__](CodeDuplication)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid duplication code.
* [__CommentClutter.ipynb__](CommentClutter)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using comments inside a method.
* [__DictionaryMisuse.ipynb__](DictionaryMisuse)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid incorrect usage of the .keys() and .values() methods with dictionaries.
* [__ErrorHandling.ipynb__](ErrorHandling)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid not specifying the exception in the 'except' clause.
* [__GlobalVariable.ipynb__](GlobalVariable)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid global variable.
* [__ImmutableDefaults.ipynb__](ImmutableDefaults)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid mutable defaults.
* [__LimitOutputs.ipynb__](LimitOutputs)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using excessive display of irrelevant outputs or graphs.
* [__LongCells.ipynb__](LongCells)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid long cells.
* [__MagicNumbers.ipynb__](MagicNumbers)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid magic numbers.
* [__MarkdownCells.ipynb__](MarkdownCells)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid not taking advantage of markdown cells.
* [__MultiTest.ipynb__](MultiTest)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid multi-Test leakage.
* [__NestedList.ipynb__](NestedList)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid using nested list comprehensions.
* [__PreprocessingLeakage.ipynb__](PreprocessingLeakage)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid preprocessing leakage.
* [__TestTraining.ipynb__](TestTraining)  - is a Jupyter Notebook file can be used to avoid including test Data in the training data.
